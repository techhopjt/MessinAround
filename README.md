============

####This is a personal repository filled with code that I have used or am using currently. 

Any and all woks in here will be pertaining to stuff I have in development, or things that I am learning from.

This repo will also pertain to copy/pasta'd code tht I have found, mostly from websites. This is done to develop a better understanding of CSS/HTML5 and a way for me to learn from other people's mistakes.
